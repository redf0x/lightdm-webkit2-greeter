## Disclaimer

Dear stranger, if you came along here, just keep on your way. There's nothing to look at. I forked this project because it looked stalled and all I wanted is fancy greeter for myself. I needed to make some changes, but I don't have any plans to take over this project and maintain it in the long run, so this one won't be maintained and will be likely abandoned in the course of time. However, if you still want to entrust yourself to the volatile destiny of things, so be it. But use this software at your own risk. You've been warned.

## Theme JavaScript API:
The greeter exposes a JavaScript API to greeter themes which they must use to interact with the greeter (in order to facilitate the user login process). The [API Documentation](https://antergos.com/wiki/development/lightdm-webkit2-greeter-theme-javascript-api/) is a W.I.P.
